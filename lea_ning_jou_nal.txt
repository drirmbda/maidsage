Topic 1: Initiating and managing export relationships

Within international business, managing export relationships is a key concern. Relationships existing between the exporting business and other members of the international distribution channel can substantially enhance or impede performance in export markets. The case discusses how Ronstan, an Australian International company that manufactures marine hardware has successfully managed its export relationships in different countries of operation. The company has evolved from a backyard boat building project to a large manufacturer of marine hardware in Australia and internationally. The company has developed a strong distribution network both domestically and overseas. The results have been achieved through the development and maintenance of good and close relations.

The reading strongly reflects the content delivered in the lecture regarding the topic. Multinationals must develop a distribution strategy based on strong relationships in order to penetrate markets. To get the desired distribution chain, an international business will require a clear product offering as well as a convincing reason to why the distributor should invest efforts towards it. Additionally, managing export relationships requires hard work from both the business and foreign distributor. Maintaining positive relationships is imperative given that distributors are like customers and employees in one. They represent the international firm like employees and have demanding requirements such as those of customers. Ideally, there is a need for a good rapport between the firm and distributor in order to optimize distributor performance. The class readings, lecture, and class content emphasize the importance of the managing export relationships.

One thing I would like to add to the points raised in the class discussion is that one important factor in the relationship is the distributor´s margin. Business has to determine a reasonable retail price to give away to the distributor. Balancing the margin helps balance the relationship. Most successful international organizations recognize the importance of distributor relationships as an important driver of market dominance, revenue, and profitability. As a result, the organizations are strategically adept and  [[http://www.ocarinaclub.cn/comment/html/?28416.html|ì°ë¦¬ì¹´ì§ë¸]] focus on building necessary relationships in order to thrive.

When a business´s relationships are aligned with strong distributor capabilities, the enterprise is likely to enjoy a coherence premium in the form of an extremely strong market position and superior performance. However, the coherence is not common among all international firms. More often, firm´s business strategies are divorced from their distributors´ strategies. As a result, firms are forced to contend with conflicting demands that substantially drive up costs. An effective distribution strategy defines the operations of the firm´s distribution expectations.

This demonstrates that relationships significantly influence the cost benefit of operational components of business. Hence, international businesses should establish strong relationships to leverage core competencies of the business to realize a defined objective or high-level goal. Thus, establishing relationships supports the implementation of business strategy in foreign markets.  There is nothing relevant to this topic that was left out in the lecture. There are various things that I could tell an exporter if I was to give advice. First, negative relationships with distributors can cause various sub-problems. It is therefore for the benefit of international firms to formulate distributor plans. The first sub problem is the inability to attract and retain key distributors in the foreign market. Committed distributors play a significant role in the success of the business. Without a plan, it is difficult to attract and retain key distributors. The plan can help international business enhance its chances of success and remain competitive. 

I agree with the author on the significance of managing export relationships. Other researchers have consistently shown that the right choice of partner in international market critical to the success of an international organization. Setting and agreeing on expectation is the key to establishing strong relationships with distributors from the outset. Other types of details that the business may want to consider include marketing plans, sales objectives, pricing, exclusivity, discounts, margins and payment terms. The content learned to relate to the knowledge of other units of the study in a number of ways. Organizations reach the market in different ways. Distributors are important because they make a one-on-one contractual relationship with different suppliers of choice. Firms reach the market through different channels provided by both local and international distributors. Through this, consumers can access products and services from stores and other designated outlets in various parts of the world. Distributors are important components of international organization´s success. The alignment of its supply chain strategy with its business strategy is based on distributor relationships in existence.

An example of a company that illustrates the issues discussed in class is Apple Inc. Apple´s distribution chain provides the company with numerous advantages in the market. Its distribution practices are unique in various ways. An outstanding aspect of Apple´s distribution chain is its practice of maintaining strong relationships with different components of the distribution chain. Other distribution channels include retail stores and other distributors. Apple works with a comparatively small number of distributors. This is beneficial in because the company maintains a small range of products. Apple closely controls its distribution in order to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. Successful distribution management requires close control to maintain the good image of a company. Without close control, a firm´s image can be severely damaged. The narrow depth and breadth of Apple´s product line increases negotiating power over distributors, facilitates marketing and preserves management attention.

There are many examples and incidents of both effective and poor management of export relationships. The article by Deligonul et al., (2006) discusses how sum sang has been able to reach its current position through the building and promoting strong relationships with distributors. Samsung Company started out as a small export business in Taegu,  ë°ì¹´ë¼ì¬ì´í¸ Korea. Today, it is one of the global leading electronics firms that specialize in media, digital appliances, memory, semiconductors, and system integration. Its products are recognized as some of the most top quality and innovative products and processes around the world. It was established in 1938. The firm began to expand its product lines and reach to grow its revenue and market share. Sam sung undertakes a holistic approach to distribution. It takes advantage of different distribution channels to reach the market. The firm uses a selective distribution strategy, which is characterized by a degree of exclusivity. To achieve efficiency, it authorizes its distributors to ensure a level of control over distribution while maintaining strong relationships.

A discussion with fellow students led to the findings that any good export relationship needs regular work.   There are linkages between this week´s topic and previous ones we have covered. I have not changed my mind about something I wrote earlier in the semester. The practice of keeping journal has taught the importance of keeping thoughts that can be immortalized for the future.



Topic 2: The legal dimension of exporting

The legal environment of any country determines how export activities are carried out by different players in the market. Legal systems vary, and operations of exporters in a different country are different from those of other countries. Laws might also constrain some activities such as product packaging, labeling, marking, and contracts. The linkage between lecture, reading and class content for this topic can be seen in how laws affect commercial activities. In both private and public sectors, organizations are facing increasing pressure to adhere to applicable rules of law. New regulatory requirements have resulted in an increasing recognition of the importance of adherence. This has also brought a growing recognition for the need to satisfy increasing analytical needs and compliance to consumer requirements. Understanding legal issues involved in exporting leaves the business free to get on and build its export sales. This is important because governments are keen on exports. Ensuring that the business complies with overseas legal requirements, there is need to anticipate potential problems. Businesses need to secure their intellectual property and ensure that they draw up clear contracts with agents and customers.

Reflecting on the class discussion, there are two points I would like to add to the points that were raised. First, it is beneficial for businesses to adhere to rules and regulations. For example, there are various reasons why a business should administer a contract. A contract is a tool to ensuring that all parties comply with their scope. A Contract Is based on premise Offer and Acceptance. It binds the parties on legal formalities, specific conditions, general conditions and their obligations to one another. Investing in Contracts can assure Stakeholders that the business can be completed according to overall satisfaction and specifications. Contracts can range from a single to a series of contracts. They may concern the provision of a product or service of comparatively low monetary value that requires little more than a short term formal dealings through contracts for long term provision of product and service. Not adhering to such rules may result in losses in the form of fines, damage to reputation and business.

The second point is that while laws vary from country to country, there are uniform laws that guide commercial transactions and may exist in simple modifications to suit the context. For example, the Uniform code of conduct. The Uniform Commercial Code relates to wide range of commercial instruments and business transactions. These include the sale of goods and particular credit transactions. Uniform Commercial Code allows buyers to stop the shipment of products from sellers. It allows both parties to hold an offer open. Section 2-205 provides companies can hold open that offers are irrevocable for a particular period. The revocation should occur within a reasonable time after discovering the grounds for revocation. Revocation of is effective after the buyer notifies the supplier.  Various remedies are available to a company after proper revocation. This law has a huge bearing on those companies dealing with exports.

One thing the lecturer should have said is exporting overseas and that dealing with business partners can often result in complex problems. If not careful, these problems can quickly become long-running nightmares. There are many legal matters that exporters should become aware of when planning to export overseas. If the business does not familiarize itself with the key legal issues, it will become exposed to significant financial risks. One such way to deal with such risks is to get a legal agreement drafted with parties before engaging in business with importers. The agreements can take the form of export agreement, sales agreement, terms and conditions, import agreement and others.

The advice I could give an exporter based on what I have learnt is that exporting is normally subject to a number of laws. Some products and services are subject to different export restrictions. As a result,  [[https://www.gabeoderberg.com/gabes__Friends.php|ëí¹ì¹´ì§ë¸]] international trade can be very complex. These include contracts that may lack standard terms and conditions´ that may be found in print. Before negotiating, it may be necessary to ask for advice on the legal implications from a professional or specialist in international contracts. Other factors that may affect export activities include differences between legal systems, Product liability, Rules of competition, Patent registration, the question of which laws will apply in disputes and Extra-territoriality of overseas legislation. Additionally, export sales to specific purchasers may be restricted.

To what extent do I agree with the authors of the readings we have been assigned? Can I think of alternative views and perspectives? I considerably agree with the author of the article. Intellectual property rights grant originators rights and patents that prevent others from using inventors´ creation without their consent. Any form of imitation or theft greatly hurt profits and reduce the pace and quantity of distribution. Many countries have passed laws to allow compulsory licensing of all products manufactured domestically. However, various firms and individuals have made consistent attempt to benefit from other´s creations or  [[http://theatreyalta.com/out.php?link=https://pasangiklanboss.com/user/profile/457047|í¼ì¤í¸ì¹´ì§ë¸]] prevent the law´s implementation. The United States has threatened to place trade sanctions on the country in efforts to see a change in related policies. The problem is extreme with different companies suffering huge losses.

The content learned relate to the knowledge I have gained from other units of study. Globalization has led to the increase and penetration of businesses into places that they did not reach before. As a result, businesses cow conduct their operations on a global level. To be more precise, organizations have increased their rate of international market penetration or developed entirely new global markets. However, this means that businesses are required to adhere to a range of laws that may conflict from one country to the other. Hence, a focus on the knowledge of the laws and regulations guiding export activities is imperative.  There is a clear linkage between this week´s topic and previous ones we have covered. This week´s journal keeping activity has taught me the regulatory risks associated with export activities. Before the begging of the class, I did not realize how business dealings are influenced by complex regulatory environments. I now realize that usually, once goods or products reach the borders of the nation, the legislation of that nation applies.
