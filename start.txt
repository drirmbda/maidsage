====== Welcome to the Independent SAFE Network Wiki ======

The SAFE Network project is vast and complex. While there are great resources available online for study, these resources still tend to be hard to locate and digest. The [[http://safenetforum.org|SAFE Network Forum]] contains many years-worth of great information but lacks concise and up-to-date summaries which would be convenient for newcomers to catch up.

The purpose of this wiki is to make the SAFE Network project more accessible. This is starting-out as a growing collection of personal notes of the editor trying to thoroughly understand the project, and is intended to evolve into an independent guide to SAFE Network.

All information here is unofficial. You are free to edit and contribute right here as you learn about MaidSafe and SAFE Network yourself. This Wiki fills gaps, referencing existing resources whenever possible. Opinions belong on the Safenet forum.

===== 2. Goals of the SAFE Network =====

<lead>Cutting through marketing and hype, we are interested in which of the many good things SAFE Network will do for it's users will matter most to you. Understand what SAFE Network is really about, and why it's worth the wait.
</lead>

Furthermore, understanding which features are at the core, and which are higher level or add-ons will help to focus development and create a stronger foundation made to last. The separation between core goals and non-core goals is unofficial, but an attempt to rank the importance of features.

==== 2.1 SAFE Network Core Goals (unofficial) ====

The primary goal of SAFE Network is becoming completely autonomous; impossible to change, break or stop by any single entity or group of actors.

The first iteration of the SAFE Network will achieve the following core goals [[https://safenetforum.org/t/core-goals-of-the-first-iteration-of-safe-network-at-launch/28820|(discussion)]]:

  - de-centralize ownership of certain network functions so that they cannot be changed or disabled by any group of actors(*3)
    - function: identity proofing
    - function: access control
    - function: communication
    - function: information storage
  - protect all information perpetually(*1) from unpermitted access, interception, tampering or deletion
  - preserve stored information, and end-to-end communications, and global access to these perpetually(*1) and for free(*2)
  - provide a digital medium of exchange

  * (*1) The meaning of perpetual is not clear yet. 30 years?
  * (*2) Free, except for the cost of broadband access and the user terminal.
  * (*3) That the threshold is to making changes is unclear yet. A majority?

A future iteration is expected to achieve the following additional goals
    - function: computation

Trustless network, autonomous network, and de-centralized network may be very similar ways to express the same goal.

<hidden == Open Questions ==>
(List open questions here, along with links to forum discussion, until we find some answers.)

What is perpetual?
What is the required size of group of actors to allow changes to the mechanisms of SAFE Network that guarantee the core goals?

</hidden>
==== 2.2 SAFE Network Non-Core Goals (unofficial) ====

Certain goals not included in the previous section, but on the roadmap, could be considered non-essential, or merely good-to-have. This is a list of such goals, and is subject to change:

=== Independent but important add-ons ===
  - multiple identities
  - de-centralized name resolution
  - CLI interface and API

=== Convenient and promoting adoption ===
  - SAFE Browser
  - Language bindings

=== Nice to have but not as important ===
  - RDF Format


==== 2.3 Benefits ====

Benefits will be the results of SAFE Network achieving its goals.
Many individual benefits may not be unique to SAFE Network, but the combination of a large number of them might be.

=== Relevant to the user ===
  - No censorship
  - Perfect privacy
  - Full control over own data
  - No loss of data or access issues ever
  - No loss of ability to communicate ever
  - Always on; 100% availability

== Cryptocurrency benefits relevant to users ==
  - No transaction fees
  - Anonymous and untraceable transactions

== Open Questions ==

Does permanent availability of published data not contradict having full control over own data?

=== Relevant to the developer ===

  - No need to implement and maintain reliable data storage
  - No need to implement and maintain basic security measures
  - No need to implement authentication
  - Get paid for development of software
  - Inherently scaling storage infrastructure

=== Relevant to technical progress ===

  - Scalable immutable transaction ledger
  - Scalable cryptocurrency (without a block chain)

=== Relevant to our planet ===
  - Consensus at low power consumption
  - Secure cryptocurrency at low power cost (in contrast to PoW)


==== 2.4 Roadmap and Beyond ====

[[https://safenetwork.tech/roadmap/|Official Project Roadmap]] and a summary:

  * Alpha 2 - Live! - Interact with a network of MaidSafe vaults using SAFEBrowser - PUT limits apply, minimum forum membership level required. Data will not be carried forward to next releases.
    * Self-Authentication - logging into network without centralized permissioning
    * Self-Encryption - splitting files into chunks, hashing, encryption
    * Disjoint Sections - splitting (and combining/) sections based on network size
    * Message Relay - early iteration - messaging capability without signature verification

===== 3. Architecture =====

<lead>A good architecture of SAFE Network is incredibly important for long-term success. This section will be an attempt to give an accurate overview.
</lead>


==== 3.1 Place in OSI Reference Model ====

Layers 0-4 will provide the basis for communication, without modification. Internet/Routing (Layer 3) will be based on IPv4 and/or IPv6. Host-to-host Transport (Layer 4) will provide QUIC transport, which is based on UDP (a connection-less service). SAFE Network will not modify anything below and including Layer 3. SAFE Network will add to Layer 4, and functions in Layers 5, 6, and 7:

LAYER 7 - Application: Vaults, SAFE Browser, Authenticator, SDNS, (not sure about SFTP, SNTP, SIMAP) (tentatively placed here until verified)

LAYER 6 - Presentation: "Self-Encryption" (tentatively placed here until verified)

LAYER 5 - Session: Session ID and network entry point selection, Self-Authentication (tentative)

LAYER 4 - Routing: SAFE Network PARSEC Consensus, and Kademlia Distributed Hash Table-based Routing, using QUIC/UDP

<hidden == Note on CRUST ==>
CRUST will be replaced by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC|QUIC]] (originally: Quick UDP Internet Connections), which relies on UDP/IP.
</hidden>
==== 3.2 SAFE Network Overlay Network ====

The SAFE Network is a virtual overlay network on the Internet, consisting of SAFE Network Nodes, which correspond to an instance of SAFE Network "Vault" software in the real world. Nodes are dynamically organized by the network as Vaults come, gain trust over time, and leave the network.

=== SAFE Network Address Space ===

SAFE Network Nodes exist in the virtual overlay network in a multi-dimensional space called the XOR Space. There is no correlation between geographical distance (or IP address distance) between physical nodes in the real world, and distance between the same nodes in XOR Space. This is the result of how Node IDs are allocated by the SAFE Network. People running a Vault have no control over this process, which is an important security feature.

In XOR space, the distance between Nodes is the XOR of the IDs of the two Nodes, which is read as an unsigned integer. Distance is used for routing in this space and for organizing Nodes into groups, as well as for allocating responsibilities over other entities in SAFE Network XOR space such as "Clients" and units of data ("Chunks"), which also have an ID using which distances to Nodes can be calculated in exactly the same way.

Clients need to connect to Nodes to access the SAFE Network and the appropriate node is decided based on distance. Chunks are managed by groups of Nodes, which are also determined by distance. Chunks of data derive their ID from a hash of the contents of the chunk.

  * Entities in XOR Space: Vault Nodes, Clients, Chunks (other?)
  * XOR Space addresses length: 256 bits

=== Organization of Objects and Entities ===

The XOR space is dynamically subdivided by a sectioning algorithm into a growing number of dis-joint XOR sub-spaces as the number of Nodes grows. The sub-spaces are called "Sections". Nearby Sections of Nodes watch over each other, and within each Section a hierarchy of Nodes exists based on Age, which determines the level of trust, responsibility of a Node, and the power it has over other Nodes.

Sections run PARSEC consensus algorithms to make decisions, and sign decisions using a group signature so that neighboring Sections can verify them. Decisions (and events) are stored in Data Chains.

  * Algorithms: Sectioning, ... (other TBD)
  * Section group size and split threshold: 8 (typical number which may be changed in the future)
  * Consensus threshold: 5 out of 8 (62.5% (of "quorum size"?))
  * Information held by Sections: Data Chains (of a Section, or a neighboring Section), Routing Table

=== Object and Entity Types ===
(open for review and contribution; may be incomplete or outdated, as of 2015)

  * Users accessing the network (clients)
    * Passports (ID linked to multiple sub-IDs)
      * Anonymous ID (MA-ID) - for anonymous network access
      * Public IDs (MP-ID) - for public network access
      * Share IDs (MS-ID) - can be associated with multiple Passports - for access to private shares
      * Proxy IDs (PM-ID) - for providing own resources
  * People providing resources to the network: vaults (farmers)
    * Vaults (instances of a vault node)
      * ClientManager vault persona - part of a group but independently relaying traffic between client and the correct DataManagers
      * DataManager vault persona - part of a group but independently forwarding requests to the correct DataHolders
      * DataHolderManager vault persona - part of a group but independently selecting and observing DataHolders
      * DataHolder vault persona - part of a group but independently judging validity of requests
      * (what is the 5th persona, or is the 5th not a persona but the client?)
==== 3.3 Basic Facilities ====
(work in progress)

  * Storage of ALL information is in a network wide DHT
  * ALL nodes are connected to at least four neighbors
  * ALL inter-node communication is authenticated and encrypted (PKI)


==== 3.4 Transport Protocol for P2P ====

=== 3.4.1 IETF QUIC Introduction ===

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC|QUIC]] (originally: Quick UDP Internet Connections), is a new Internet transport protocol that intends to replace TCP and TLS. It relies on UDP datagrams over IP. [[https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/|This]] is a good introduction. Standard [[https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts|IETF QUIC]] started as Google's QUIC or qQUIC but has significantly diverged and improved.

Multiplexing of multiple streams reduces the number of QUIC connections and handshakes and makes streams less sensitive to congestion and faster. Authentication and encryption are not delegated to a higher layer protocol like TLS resulting in higher speed and better security. A typical handshake takes only one round trip. However, UDP protocols are susceptible to reflection attacks and to avoid this the server can cryptographically confirm if requestor and destination are the same, at the expense of doubling the handshake duration.

There are some early adopter issues such as worse handling of NAT by the typical router designed with only TCP in mind. Second, connections are uniquely identified and tracked by connection ID because ports and even IP address of endpoints may change, which is a feature of QUIC. However, conventional routers may not be able to deliver the UDP packets correctly to the right end-point after such QUIC endpoint change. Finally, performance may suffer compared to TCP due to a general lack of off-loading capabilities of processing to OS or network interface hardware.

=== 3.4.2 MDSF Lib quic-p2p ===

MaidSafe [[https://crates.io/crates/quic-p2p|quick-p2p]] ([[https://docs.rs/quic-p2p/0.1.1/quic_p2p/|0.1.1 docs]],[[https://github.com/maidsafe/quic-p2p/projects/2|to do]]) is a library implementing QUIC using [[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning-resources/tls-1-3/|TLS 1.3]].

The library provides 2 connection types in P2P mode: Bi-directional and uni-directional.

Uni-directional type is used to force to prove a node's ability to accept incoming connections and create outgoing connections, which is a necessary requirement to be accepted as a network peer worker node.

The library provides 3 connection types of different identity certification levels:
  * Agreed CA certificates required
  * Private CA certificates allowed
  * No Identity certification required

The most recent 200 endpoints that are not behind NAT, and their certificates are cached and used for re-joining of nodes.

==== 3.5 Routing in MSNW ====

=== 3.5.1 Kademlia Routing Introduction ===

Kademlia (this is just a name given by the authors’ paper in 2002) routing prescribes how to establish a route through a decentralized network of nodes which only have a limited view of the network (partial routing tables), with a minimal number of node queries. For an n node addresses network that number is Order log(n) nodes. Nodes build their routing tables from queries they receive.

The concept of mathematical distance is used to recursively home-in from the perspective of the originating node on a destination address.

Distance metrics must satisfy the following conditions:
  - zero distance between two nodes always mean that those nodes must be one and the same,
  - distances between two nodes are the same no matter which is the origin, and always positive too,
  - the triangle distance inequality applies. to any three nodes, which means that there always is a distance between one pair of these nodes that is equal or shorter than the sum of the distances between the remaining two node pairs. 

The creators of Kademlia proposed the XOR distance metric as a “novel” metric. The metric meets the above requirements. However, it is not Euclidean. A distance is not Euclid’s 5th “parallel” postulate does not hold.

Interesting properties include the fact that other nodes as seen from a node all have unique distances. This results in the “homing-in” from any originating node to converge to a common path as the destination is approached.

The route is not a physical route, but only a journey of visiting and querying nodes, each having only partial knowledge of other nodes in the overlay, in order to find the IP and port number of the destination node.

=== 3.5.2 MDSF Lib routing ====

MaidSafe [[https://crates.io/crates/routing|routing]] ([[https://docs.rs/routing/0.37.0/routing/|0.37.0 docs]], [[https://github.com/maidsafe/routing/projects?query=is%3Aopen|projects]]) implements Kademlia-like routing.
===== 4. Mechanisms =====
<lead>In this section we will try to separate out and have a closer look at the mechanisms that will keep the SAFE Network working as intended. Each of these need to be checked for possible weaknesses that could lead to disastrous malicious attacks.
</lead>


==== 4.1 Security Aspects ====
(work in progress - brainstorming phase. Note that it may not be meaningful to consider each of the items below prematurely, e.g. in the context of an alpha release.)

  * [[https://safenetforum.org/t/open-security-issues/29092/1|Brain storming thread]]

=== Unknowns due to lack of documentation ===
(this section is for listing potential gaps in documentation or changes since last review.)

==== 4.2 Mechanisms to Ensure Security ====
(work in progress)

The following is based on a 2015 peer-reviewed paper. It may not reflect the current code, and the implementation at time of launch may differ from this too. However, it does provides a clear reference for discussion.

Distance in XOR space between entities plays a key role, see discussion elsewhere. Note that:
  * a client must be closest CM-Ps,
  * a data chunk must be closest to DH-Ps, DHM-Ps, and DM-Ps.

== Maintaining Security of ClientManager vault Personas (CM-P) ==
  - Four CM-Ps per Client
  - Roles to be guaranteed (Primarily: maintain Client IP address anonymity)
    - Identify 4 DM-Ps closest to a given key-value pair (data chunk)
    - Forward request to the 4 DM-Ps
    - Anonymize Client by protecting Client IP address information

== Maintaining Security of DataManager vault Personas (DM-P) ==
  - One DM-P per 4 DHM-Ps
  - Roles to be guaranteed (Primary: data/DH-P availability (churn handling) andintegrity management)
    - Validate request received from CM-Ps
      - Check if CM-Ps are the nearest to the Client
    - Select and maintain 4 random DH-Ps
    - Determine nearest 4 DHM-Ps to each DH-P
    - Maintain minimum level of data replication

== Maintaining Security of DataHolderManager vault Personas (DHM-P) ==
  - One DHM-P per DH-P
  - Roles to be guaranteed (Primarily: monitoring DH-P availability and integrity, and maintain DH-P IP address anonymity)
    - Validate requests received from DataManagers
    - Observe their DH-P and report issues
      - Maintain and check continued connectivity quickly
      - Periodically perform PoR check of their DH-P
    - Anonymize DH-P by protecting their IP address information

== Maintaining Security of DataHolder vault Personas (DH-P) ==
  - One DH-P per unique data chunk
  - Roles to be guaranteed (Primarily: proof of resource)
    - Validate requests received from DataHolderManagers
      - Check if DHM-Ps are actually the nearest nodes to DH-P
      - Confirm agreement among DHM-Ps about the request
    - Store/retrieve key-value pairs (data chunk) as requested
    - Provide Proof-of-Resource (PoR) to DataManagers (is this correct? or is it DataHolderManagers?)

(documentation of current and future plan would be nice)

==== 4.3 Other Operating Mechanisms ====

=== Self-configuration process ===

SAFE Network will create a routed overlay network (OSI Layer 4) on top of an Internet of interconnected computing devices. All aspects from the overlay routing upwards should be de-centralized, consensus-based, and completely autonomous.

=== Self-Authentication ===


=== Self-Encryption ===


=== Maintaining the rules ===

== Decentralized Consensus ==

All transactions or decisions are consented according to the rules of the network and recorded in a transaction ledger that acts as the ground truth to base future transactions on.

MaidSafe claims a world's first decentralized, asynchronous, Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism that works in permission-less networks and that is open source.

===== 5. Economics =====
<lead>One special mechanism regulating the network involves SafeCoin, a medium of exchange within the network, but with a reach well beyond it. This section is intended to consider this from an Economist's viewpoint.
</lead>

SAFE Network will have a native cryptocurrency called SafeCoin, providing incentives to people to support the network with resources and applications, and charging network users for certain kinds of usage.

To raise funding for the project a token called MAID was created. MAID will be exchanged for SafeCoin at the launch of the SAFE Network.
==== 5.1 MAID pre-launch ====
(MAID creation to fund development)



==== 5.2 MAID and SafeCoin at launch ====
(scenarios impacting the value of MAID at conversion to SafeCoin)

At this time it is expected that one MAID token will be exchanged for son SafeCoin.

Source: [[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477|this]], [[https://github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/blob/master/Project-Safe.md|Project-Safe whitepaper April 2014]](outdated??)

  * Pre-launch supply (MAID): 452 M (452,552,412 units)
  * Investor allocation: 226 M
  * Maximum supply: 678 M

5% of total supply [of 678M??] goes to early investor/family

5% of total supply [of 678M??] goes to dev team
==== 5.3 SafeCoin ====
(money supply, economic output, inflation)

  * SafeCoin will be almost infinitely divisible 

=== 5.3.1 SafeCoin supply ===
(following needs confirmation.) [[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477|4/2017]], [[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477/11|authoritative April 2017]]

  * Pre-launch supply (MAID): 452 M (452,552,412 units) - slightly* over 10% (10.5%) of total supply, available at day 1
  * Early investor allocation: 215 M - (about?) 5% of total supply available at day 1
  * Maximum supply: 4.3B (4,294,967,295; 2^32-1)

*) Slighyly more by a few million due to error at MAID sale. [[https://safenetforum.org/t/maidsafecoin-maid-price-trading-topic/9923/6436|@neo]]

=== 5.3.2 SafeCoin creation ===
(following needs confirmation.) 

[[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477|4/2017]], [[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477/11|authoritative April 2017]],[[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477/14|@neo]]

SafeCoin goes to
  * Farmers - Depending on supply of available but unused storage; the (instantaneous) farming rate.
  * Network maintenance - Every GET on average pays core devs 5% of farming rate
  * App developers - Every GET due to an App pays 10% of farming rate
  * PtP (Pay the Provider - [[https://safenetforum.org/t/poll-should-maidsafe-implement-ptp-pay-the-producer/5805|under discussion]]) - Every GET for specific data could pay 10% of farming rate

Farming rate is explained in [[https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs/blob/47e3e688d6eb0709fbeee742f2865b50233dc98a/text/0012-safecoin-implementation/0012-safecoin-implementation.md|RFC-0012]].

=== 5.3.3 SafeCoin destruction ===
[[https://safenetforum.org/t/safecoin-supply/13477/13|@polpolrene]]

SafeCoins are destroyed/consumed by the network at:
  * Account creation (address/ID)
  * Domain name purchase
  * PUT of data (immutable data will be much less expensive than mutable data)

=== What determines the exchange value of SafeCoin ===

Since SAFE Coin will regulate availability of (secure and perpetual decentralized) storage, it may be expected to be as stable as that commodity. However, speculation and application for predominantly other uses might change the situation significantly.

===== 6. MAID and SafeCoin for Holders and Traders =====
<lead> Dealing with MAID and SAFE Network tokens is much more complicated than dealing with cash. This should be a guide to make things easier.
</lead>

=== What is MAID ===

MAID is a token that exists in the OMNI layer on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

=== What is SafeCoin ===

SafeCoin will be the native medium of exchange within SAFE Network, and is supposed to replace MAID at the time of launch of the network.

Warning: SafeCoin is NOT [[https://safecoin.org/|this]].

=== Exchanges trading MAID ===

As a general rule, do not leave large amount of MAID (or any other coins) on an exchange.

  * [[http://www.bitker.com|Bitker]] - MAIDSafe [[https://safenetforum.org/t/removal-of-maidsafe-assets-from-bitker/29191|decided]] to remove MAID from Bitker in July 2019.

  * [[https://hitbtc.com/exchange/MAID-to-BTC|HitBTC]]: MAID/BTC, MAID/ETH, MAID/USDT. Consider the high level of complaints on social media about losing access to funds. MaidSafe does seem to have some leverage over HitBTC and could help get issues resolved.

=== Storing MAID offline ===

Storing large amounts on exchanges is not a good idea. However, before you create a paper BTC wallet and send MAID to it, read through the steps needed to send the MAID back from the paper wallet to an exchange and decide if is worth the trouble and the risks of making mistakes and of reduced liquidity.

===== A. Unofficial FAQ =====

<lead> This section answers some questions that we could not easily find elsewhere. You can check the official [[https://safenetwork.tech/faq/|FAQ]] for other questions.
</lead>
=== Terminology ===

**Clearnetwork** : Refers to the Internet as we know it today, which is what SAFE Network will replace.

**MaidSafe** : "Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone", the name of the entity leading the development of the SAFE Network.

**MVP** : Minimum Viable Product: As defined in 2016, not the final product with messaging and SafeCoin, but a working network for storage, that may not guarantee perpetual data storage yet as it would be un-paid. In 2019 the meaning has changed [[https://safenetforum.org/t/maidsafecoin-maid-price-trading-topic/9923/7035|see here]], and replaced by a concrete roadmap.

**PARSEC** : Protocol for Asynchronous, Reliable, Secure and Efficient Consensus: An open sourced library

**SAFE Network** : “Secure Access for Everyone Network”, the name of the new Internet.
