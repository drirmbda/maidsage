In a Tuesday night interview with CNN's Don Lemon, Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director, said that although Whoopi's comments caused 'tremendous confusion and hurt,' he accepted her apology and hopes she can use her suspension as a time for 'introspection and learning'.
'She apologized last night online and then she did so again this morning.

You know, and I accept her apology,' Greenblatt said.
'I know she's been a friend of the jewish community all throughout her career. And I respect that and appreciate it. I can't comment on ABC News' internal process, but what I will say is that I hope Whoopi can use the next two weeks for a process of introspection and learning.' 
Greenblatt added: 'Let's hope that she can use this time, use this opportunity, and use her amazing platform to educate herself and to share what she learns with her audience and with the country at large.'
He encouraged the television host to find ways to help further Holocaust education by visiting the Holocaust museum, meeting with survivors and working with the ADL. 
'There are lots of ways Whoopi can make I huge difference, and I hope she'll do that.'
Greenblatt also reiterated the Holocaust was 'absolutely about race'.
'I think [Whoopi] really, again, created a kind of confusion and hurt because the Holocaust was absolutely about race,' he told Lemon. 'It was a racialized anti-semitism.'
'And again, that might not fit with the way that some people think about race, the way all of us as Americans have to confront  it in this country - in this time when black Americans are still dealing with the legacy of Jim Crow and enslavement and systemic oppression.'

       He continued: 'And yet, race is a social construct and it shows up differently in different societies.
'If we look back to Germany, the Nazis believed that they were the master race and Jews were a subhuman race ...

They waged a war of extermination against the jewish people because of this belief in race. That's undeniable. It's what happened.'
Greenblatt also said Whoopi should be 'counseled, not cancelled' as she 'it seems like she's ready to commit to doing better'.
The ADL leader added that he's 'excited' to help the actress 'with that process'.

'We don't learn through punishment. The suspension is wrong. We've gone too far,' tweeted Chris Safford.
'The people that decided that Whoopi's should be suspended are a bunch no of spineless idiots.

Did they ever suspend Megan McCain?? As a Jew I'm calling this bulls**t,' echoed Barbara Steinberg.  
'These so called "consequences" are cancel culture in many cases and two wrongs never made a right,' user @FleischmanSteve added.
'There's too much of this s**t in this country and it's obnoxious. I think Whoopi was wrong but didn't deserve a suspension.'

Others argue the network's actions weren't severe enough and continue to call for her termination.
'Whoopi Goldberg makes a horrible comment about the Jews and gets suspended for 2 weeks, No that's not enough,' tweeted @bryan112886 'Fire her decrepit a** and let her enjoy retirement.'
'Roseanne Barr is a comedian and was fired for a joke.

Whoopi is a comedian that wasn't joking,' argued @hardinkk2.
'Imagine a white person or a Jew saying slavery wasn't about race, it was just business,' @ayDursi wrote.
'Then they proceed to downplay one of if not the most horrific American tragedies Unforgivable right?

Then ask yourself why is Whoopi still on tv after saying identical comments.'
Twitter user @VisitorPaul added: 'Was Sharon Osborne "suspended for 2 weeks"? Nope, Whoopi needs to get fired!!'

Whoopi posted an apology on Twitter Monday night saying the Holocaust was about 'both' race and inhumanity. 
'On today's show, I said the Holocaust "is not about race, but about man's inhumanity to man." I should have said it is about both.

As Jonathan Greenblatt from the Anti-Defamation League shared, "The Holocaust was about the Nazi's systematic annihilation of the Jewish people - who they deemed to be an inferior race." I stand corrected,' Goldberg said.
'The Jewish people around the world have always had my support and that will never waiver.

I'm sorry for the hurt I have caused. Written with my sincerest apologies, Whoopi Goldberg,' she said. 
On Tuesday, she made an on-air apology, then interviewed the CEO of The Anti-Defamation League, before moving on to other topics with her co-hosts. 
Ahead of The View's show on Tuesday, a senior ABC News source told DailyMail.com that staff are stunned by the network's soft touch on her remarks, especially when it was so quick to fire Roseanne Barr over racist comments towards Valerie Jarrett. 
'These comments are absolutely abhorrent and outrageous and it's time Disney and ABC grew a pair and fired her,' the source said.
      (Image: [[|]])   Whoopi Goldberg on Tuesday apologized again for her claim that the Holocaust 'wasn't racist' after a swell of people called for her to be fired 
       'Disney took swift action and fired Roseanne Barr when she posted the awful tweet about Valerie Jarrett, yet Whoopi made her vile comments on ABC's air and they do nothing about it?

Where is the leadership from within Disney? 
'[Disney content chairman] Peter Rice needs to step up and do his job and fire Whoopi. How is this appropriate at all? What message do we send as a company?  Why is there one rule for Whoopi Goldberg - who gets a pass on everything and another rule for everyone else?
