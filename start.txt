BA called in the police in September 5, 2018 after a cyber attack was detected by staff - 16 days after it started on August 21.

During the data breach tens of thousands of customers had their name, billing address,  [[https://www.ccgood.best|CCGOOdBest]] email address, card payment information - including card number, expiry date and their CVV security code - potentially compromised.
Hundreds of thousands more had their personal details taken without their CVV code captured, it was said.
British Airways chairman Alex Cruz said today the airline was 'disappointed' by the initial finding - despite initial warnings the fine could be up to £500million.
He said: 'British Airways responded quickly to a criminal act to steal customers' data.

We have found no evidence of fraud/fraudulent activity on accounts linked to the theft. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience this event caused.'
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said it would consider appealing the fine as it seeks 'to take all appropriate steps to defend the airline's position vigorously'.

The data breach affected  380,000 customers who booked flights online or via the BA app between April 21 and July 28, 2018, and who used a payment card. 
BA has insisted it had told customers about the security breach as soon as it could.
But the cyber failure is a massive blow to the airline's once renowned reputation for customer service with some victims vowing never to use them again. 
The stolen data did not include passport details but did include 'personal information, the airline said. 
BA said it had received no reports from customers who had had money fraudulently taken out of their account. 
Following disclosure of the hack, BA promised to compensate affected customers and took out full-page adverts in British newspapers, including the Daily Mail, to apologise to passengers.
It had meanwhile described the mass theft as 'a very sophisticated, malicious, criminal attack on our website'.

IAG is the owner of five airlines, including also Aer Lingus, Iberia, Level and Vueling, none of which were affected by the hack.
GDPR establishes the key principle that individuals must explicitly grant permission for their data to be used.
The case for the new rules had been boosted by a scandal over the harvesting of Facebook users' data by Cambridge Analytica, a US-British political research firm, for the 2016 US presidential election. 
BA's proposed penalty is roughly 367 times the £500,000 imposed on Facebook  over the scandal. 
Rachel Aldighieri, managing director of the Data & Marketing Association (DMA), said: 'This is the first fine the ICO has announced under the new GDPR laws and the level of the proposed fine is unprecedented in the UK, highlighting the importance all businesses should place on the security of customers' data.
'Data is a fundamental part of the digital economy, so maintaining its security must be a business imperative.

Trust in how brands collect, store and use data is essential to the relationship between businesses and their customers.
'The risks to BA go beyond the potential fines regulators can issue too, the long-term effects on customer trust, share price and public perception could have more lasting damage.'
