Besides using the product as quickly as you can, Love also suggests opting for a serum that comes in a container that blocks out light. "Minimize the amount of time the product is exposed to air by applying it quickly to your hands and screwing the top back on the bottle securely. Some products now come in containers that don't require opening the top, so this is also helpful," says Love.

Sometimes it's OK to buy skin care products and let them sit on the shelf for a few months before using them. But you don't want to do that with products that contain vitamin C. "L-ascorbic acid [vitamin C] is difficult to stabilize, which is why a 'steal' is probably too good to be true. Both air and sunlight can oxidize vitamin C, causing it to lose some of its efficacy," says Love.

As for glam, the beauty - born Melissa Viviane Jefferson - looked picture perfect with voluminous eyelashes and bronze eyeshadow courtesy of celebrity makeup artist Alexx Mayo, who relied on skincare and cosmetics from Charlotte Tilbury for the evening. 
'For Lizzo's BET Awards look, we wanted to create both a fun and out of the box look inspired by finger waves and the mullet - resulting in the super cute mashup look she wore on the red carpet,' Shelby explained. 

Love recommends Obagi Clinical's Vitamin C + Arbutin Brightening Serum since "it contains 10% l-ascorbic acid (the purest and most potent form of vitamin C) but is formulated to be gentle on the skin. Although it has a nice slip texture to it, it is also oil-free and non-comedogenic," says Love, who works with Obaji as an opinion leader and dermatologist source.

A third added: 'I don't think I have ever used another styling product that has worked as well as Dream Coat has! From my first use in August until today, it is constantly blowing my mind by how shiny, soft, and beautiful it has made my hair'.    

Powered by collagen-boosting peptides and plumping hyaluronic acid, The Eye Lift serum from Proto-col delivers immediate results in just three minutes, lifting, firming, brightening and tightening tired-looking eyes.

According to the brand, the Proto-col The Eye Lift serum is so popular that a staggering three years' worth of stock was sold in just one month as customers rushed to try it for themselves - a tell-tale sign its a hit.

'I have very damaged hair due to bleaching it from its natural brown/black colour. With that in mind, I kept my expectations in check. After blowing drying and flat ironing I had silky manageable hair with more "life" to it,' said another.

'Unlike typical serum or oil-based humidity-fighting formulas that lay down a heavy coat on hair's surface, (which deflate volume and leave the hair greasy) Dream Coat uses a groundbreaking, heat-activated polymer technology that is lighter than a feather.

In fact, 43 percent of adults have jobs that require the usage of a tablet or computer. And American children between the ages of 8 and 12 spend four to six hours a day watching or using screens while teens spend up to 9 hours using screens. 

'Dream Coat scatters tiny droplets randomly on the hair's surface. When heated with your blow-dryer these droplets connect and crosslink, forming an invisible, hydrophobic matrix that compresses each strand into a sleek shape and sheathes it in a "raincoat" that repels moisture.'
