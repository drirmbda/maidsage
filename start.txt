====== Welcome to the Independent SAFE Network Wiki ======

The SAFE Network project is vast and complex. The purpose of this wiki is to make the SAFE Network project more accessible. This is starting-out as a growing collection of personal notes of the editor trying to thoroughly understand the project, and is intended to evolve into an independent guide to SAFE Network.

All information here is unofficial. You are free to edit and contribute right here as you learn about MaidSafe and SAFE Network yourself. This Wiki fills gaps, referencing existing resources whenever possible. Opinions belong on the [[http://safenetforum.org|SAFE Network Forum]].

<note important>
Before you can start editing your need to through automatic registration. This is needed to avoid spam. There are some [[rules]] to follow to keep this fun. The rules page also contains contact information, and legal notices.

===== 2. Goals of the SAFE Network =====

<lead>Cutting through marketing and hype, we are interested in which of the many good things SAFE Network will do for it's users will matter most to you. Understand what SAFE Network is really about, and why it's worth the wait.

===== 4. Mechanisms =====

<lead>In this section we will try to separate out and have a closer look at the mechanisms that will keep the SAFE Network working as intended. Each of these need to be checked for possible weaknesses that could lead to disastrous malicious attacks.

===== 5. Economics =====
<lead>One special mechanism regulating the network involves SafeCoin, a medium of exchange within the network, but with a reach well beyond it. This section is intended to consider this from an Economist's viewpoint.

===== 6. Dealing with MAID and SafeCoin =====

<lead> Dealing with MAID and SAFE Network tokens is much more complicated than dealing with cash. This should be a guide to make things easier.
