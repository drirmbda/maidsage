There are so many books and articles about flower arranging but your personal artistry ought to be the first step toward your work and not the thought of others.

Remember to use a sharp knife or scissors to cut flowers. Do not even try using your fingers when trimming. This is an important tip if you wish to you could make your arrangement keep going longer. A stem with the even cut enables a complete flow of water while a ragged cut will inhibit absorption making your flower wilt faster.
