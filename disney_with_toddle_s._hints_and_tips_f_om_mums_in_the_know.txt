It is a long flight over to Disney Florida, especially with a 3 year old bundle of chaotic energy. But taking your kids preschool age means you can go outside of the school holidays, potentially saving a few pounds. So is Disney with a toddler a disaster waiting to happen? Or the perfect opportunity to start their Disney magic addiction?

Some of our BabyAbroad readers have enjoyed fantastic holidays with toddlers to Disney and they are happy to share their tips and experiences with you. And trust me, this is reliable information, one mum in particular qualifies as a Disney expert having been six times with her children in the past 4 years!

Where to stay:  코인카지노주소 Florida Villa or Disney Hotel?

Our readers were split between staying in a Florida villa and hiring a car and on site hotels. Having a villa gave the parents more space to relax while the kids were in bed. Their advice was to look for villas with steps into the pool and a shelf so the kids can sit in the shallow water. Check out the safety guards at the villa before you go by contacting the villa owner directly. Some also have free use of highchairs, buggies and  [[http://www.goingeshjaltar.se/guestbook/go.php?url=https://www.mutlualisverisler.com/%3Fp=1034524|바카라사이트]] cots. In Florida, all doors are alarmed by law, so children can't get out of the villa without you knowing

Those that wanted to lap up every Disney minute really enjoyed their stays at the Disney Hotels. They are a magical experience with fantastic pools and play areas and perhaps a chance to meet some of the Disney characters at breakfast. One reader who stayed at the Disney World Yacht Club loved the pool area with it's safe parts for toddlers. Their room also had a balcony overlooking the lake, so a great place to sit and relax while their toddler slept and recharged the batteries ready for the next day of excitement. Another reader stayed at the Disney Regal Sun Resort. She also liked the pool with its fountains, jets and slides but was particularly impressed that the hotel provided games and toys for children.

Preparing for  [[http://www.whxingang.cn/home.php?mod=space&uid=3845&do=profile&from=space|우리카지노]] your day at the parks

Make the most of your Disney holiday and prepare well. Here are our readers tips for planning ahead for your day at Disney:

1. Take an aerial topper or buy one there (a ping pong ball for your car aerial), it makes your car easier to spot in the huge Disney parking lot and ALWAYS write down which row you parked in.

2. Take snacks and water into the parks. Freeze your bottles of water the night before so they stay cool in the Florida sun. Food and drink can be expensive and not so great in the parks so store snacks in a cool bag under your buggy. Refill water bottles form water fountains in parks BIG MUST, high factor sun cream, it's very hot in Florida in the summer months and drink plenty water.

3. Plan your day- where you're going, decide what time you'll be up and out, where you're going to lunch, etc. If you get to the Disney parks early, you can spend all morning there then pop back to the villa for lunch, swim, nap and go back to the Disney in the evening.

4. Try and plan the rides and shows you want to do,  [[http://www.irucz.ru/redirect.php?redirect=http2f%220href=http://ovotecegg.com/component/k2/itemlist/user/137074|우리카지노]] you won't get to do them all and lines can be long.

5. All of our readers implored 'take a buggy' to Disney even for those children at 3 ish who don't really need it any more as they may well need to take a nap in the afternoons and you are going to cover a long way on foot. If nothing else, it gives you somewhere to put your lunch!

Disney Thrifty Tips

Pick up coupon books, loads in the tourist info booths along the 192, these books give you discounts on attractions and restaurants.

One reader's husband and toddler enjoyed some bonding over the HUGE video game arcade "it would have cost the three of us $50 to enter", but it is on the multi park ticket so we got in for free, and all the games are free too.

One reader told us that she took her own seats on their Disney holiday as she found out that it can cost £100 to hire 1 seat for two weeks. Most airlines will take car seats for free in the hold but do check with your airline first.

Like our readers before you, if you take the Disney toddler plunge, then enjoy every moment. Oh and don't forget your camera.
